# Misc Python Scripts

Pieces of work that I have done with Python while I was learning it to better understand. Some are from YouTube lessons, some were experiments and college assignments, and some are just unfinished small projects. They're all from a little toybox folder I made for them.

Edit: "Billy Nator" is another name I may go by.
